	Before the war, the school occupied a large three-storey building with a library and laboratories.  That building was burned, the apparatus and library were looted and burned during the war. By March 1947 the library had been replenish and the laboratories equipped. In the same year the school transferred to its present site.

				<h2>Relocation of The Mabini Academy..</h2>
				<p>The site has been enlarged by buying adjoining lots. Its present area is 25, 610 square meters – one of the largest school sites among private schools in Batangas. On this site, the Academy has seven buildings, a basketball court, and an open stage. In 1948 a Junior College with liberal arts and normal courses was added together with a complete elementary department. The College Department however, was short-lived, closing in 1961.</p>

				<h2>Rebuilding of The Mabini Academy..</h2>
				<p>The administration building was the first to be demolished and replaced by a modern concrete edifice. In 1964, the two wings of this building, housing eight classrooms, were constructed. This was followed by remodeling of the grandstand in 1965, the construction of the first wing of the two-storey Science building in 1966, the construction of a 3-room Vocational Building in 1967, and the construction of a storey Science Building was completed.</p>

				<h2>Enrollees and establishment..</h2>
				<p>1982 had been very historical for the institution when the enrollment in the high school reached 3,100 which had been the highest number of enrollees for high school during that time in Lipa. As of today The Mabini Academy is still holding one of the highest market shares in Private secondary schools in Lipa.

                    Prior to establishment of this school, Lipa students went to Batangas or to Manila for their secondary education. This was expensive for the parents. The school’s establishment, therefore, was a great financial help to them for many years. It has been the only secondary schools in Lipa City and neighboring towns.</p>
